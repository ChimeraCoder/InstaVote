h2. Instant-Runoff Voting

"Instant Runoff Voting":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting, also known as the Alternative Vote, is a voting system that allows the user to rank the candidates in order of preference. It is superior to the 'first-past-the-post' system practiced in many states and countries, as it is arguably the system that best satisfies the criteria in "Arrow's Impossibility Theorem":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_Impossibility_Theorem


Current Implementation
----------------------

This module will identify the single winner in an election that uses instant-runoff voting rules. Future versions may be written to accomodate elections with multiple winners.
